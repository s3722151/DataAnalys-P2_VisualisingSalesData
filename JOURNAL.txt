Imported Numpy.
Reviewing this: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas-built-in-data-visualization-ml/
- I'm thinking instead of 1 dataframe, I make multiple per each area I need to chart 
- Based on data, I would make dataframes for:
- DF: To check ordering and shipping dates - Maybe see trend over time. 
- DF: Looking at Ship Mode
- DF: Segments 
- DF: Per region 
- DF: Highest Sales for Products
- DF: Lowest Sales for Products
Also reviewed lecture materials related to Practical Data Science (Week 1 - 4)

Gonna decide to end this project by using visualising tools.
This is how you get a scatter plot: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pandas-scatter-plot-dataframe-plot-scatter/
This is how you do a bar chart: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.bar.html
Gonna prompt DeepSeek to ask how to visualise it as I have busy with self-assessments and catching up to lecture vids.
- From this I did the bar charts myself.I thought I had to use something trickey to obtain column value than insert it into bar chart bandas example.
- The more colourful bar charts I had DeepSeeks help. 


To Do 
- Visualise all data
